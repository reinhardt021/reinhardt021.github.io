### Antifragile
* Barbell Strategy
* via negativa
  - try to prove hypothesis wrong much like the scientific method
  - try to disqualify hypothesis many ways before saying that there is some correlation

### Deep Work
* Deep Work Helps You Quickly Learn Hard Things
  * Deliberate Practice
     1. your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you’re trying to improve or an idea you’re trying to master
     2. you receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it’s most productive
* Deep Work Helps You Produce at an Elite Level
  * mastery of subject and focused intensity
  * batching


* **Eudaimonia Machine: Gallery (inspire) >> Salon (form ideas) >> Library (resources) >> Office (shallows) >> Chambers (deep)**


* Scheduling
  * Monastic: radically minimize shallow work in your life
  * Bimodal: Schedule long stretches of time for isolation and deep work (days or weeks)
  * Rhythmic: Schedule time everyday to do deep work (make it habitual) (can’t get as deep)
  * Journalistic: Whenever you can switch into deep work (very hard to switch like this)
* Make Grand Gestures
* **Hub & Spoke Model ~ Barbell Strategy + Bell Labs example: Theory + Execution**
* 4 Disciplines of Execution (4DX) - Christensen
  1. Focus on the Wildly Important
  2. **Act on the Lead Measures** (lag measures are too late + lead measure for deep work: time spent in deep work dedicated toward your wildly important goal)
  3. Keep a compelling Scoreboard (track hours of deep work in a prominent place - autotracked?)
  4. Create a Cadence of Accountability (regular progress reports - autogenerated?)


* Embrace Boredom
  * Don’t Take Breaks from Distraction. Instead Take Breaks from Focus.
  * Work Like Teddy Roosevelt - Dashes of intensity with artificial deadlines


* **The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection: Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts**
* Don’t Use the Internet to Entertain Yourself
* Put more thought into your leisure time

* Schedule Every Minute of Your Day
* **Quantify the Depth of Every Activity: How long would it take (in months) to train a smart recent college graduate with no specialized training in my field to complete this task?**
* Finish Your Work by Five Thirty
* Become Hard to Reach
  * Tip #1: Make People Who Send You E-mail Do More Work
  * Tip #2: Do More Work When You Send or Reply to E-mails
    * what is the project represented by this message?
    * what is the most efficient (in terms of messages generated) process for bringing this project to a successful conclusion?
  * Tip #3: Don’t Respond
    * ambiguous / hard to generate a reasonable response
    * not a question / proposal that interests you
    * nothing really good would happen if you did respond & nothing really bad would happen if you didn’t
* Bias your time toward depth

### Accelerated Learning
1. DECONSTRUCTION: find the pieces
2. SELECTION: 80 / 20
3. SEQUENCING: lead dominoes?
4. STAKES: accountability

### Scientific Method
1. CHARACTERIZATIONS (formulate a question): observations, definitions, measurements of subject of inquiry
2. HYPOTHESIS: theoretical, hypothetical explanations of observations & measurements
3. PREDICTIONS: reasoning including logical deduction from the hypothesis or theory
4. EXPERIMENTS: tests of all the above
5. ANALYSIS: determine what test results show & deciding on next actions to take
