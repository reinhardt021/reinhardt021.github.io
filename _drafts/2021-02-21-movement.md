> life is opportunity 


You don't die for revolution. You live for revolution.

wise words I once heard.
the change we seek begins within us.
will make alliances yes
but the first thing to do is live

you don't come up with a new system 
by rewriting it from the inside
you make a better system
by building somehting new 

and making the old obsolete

the best thing you can do is to distance yourself

the greatest revenge is doing well

you lived in tehre
and you know what is needed
go to those countries
and profliferate

go to others like you
improve yourself
grow
be better

watched judas and the black messiah

failed revolutions 
because they were fighting the wind

it was all around them
the whole system 
broken
and we ask for a new system

so we must learn to build a better system

outside of this one 


that is the only way we win
it is to live 

to be more
than they ever thought we could be 

be more than all of it 

if we are not against it then we are letting it happen

there is no such thing as a neutral 


everyone has the right to live

I was once a radical in mind
but the path of peace is greater
and could be done much better

I think

the one thing that should join us can be shared by many
and never taken from us



for now we build ourselves up 
we we grow ourselves

we
 that is what I can do 
 my life purpose is to provide these things easier to those people

 the ones without access

give them a resource to use

 build the knowledge for them
  build the system to help them learn systems
  to help them learn to grow and build themselves


  that should be my life's goals

  be the best at that
