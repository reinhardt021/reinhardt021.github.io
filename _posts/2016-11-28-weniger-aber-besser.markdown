1. First know what you want
2. Second eliminate the excess
3. ...

<!-- I want to make existence a better experience for others.
At any scale, this is still a big endeavor because you must first understand what can be made better.
I tend to start with myself and work to improve the worlds within before I can influence the world at large.
My overall goal is to find the processes to improve myself first then hopefully find a way to make it more efficient and effective for others to use those refined processes to improve themselves as well.
Bit of an odd goal but I find it worth pursuing. -->
