** ... Begins with a Single Step** - Lao Tzu

`Think Big, Start Small and Scale Fast. - Jim Carroll`

I want to make existence a better experience for others.
At any scale, this is still a big endeavor because you must first understand what can be made better.
I tend to start with myself and work to improve the worlds within before I can influence the world at large.
My overall goal is to find the processes to improve myself first then hopefully find a way to make it more efficient and effective for others to use those refined processes to improve themselves as well.
Bit of an odd goal but I find it worth pursuing.

`if you are not willing to risk you cannot grow /
if you cannot grow then you cannot become your best /
and if you cannot become your best you cannot be happy /
and if you cannot be happy then what else is there?`
